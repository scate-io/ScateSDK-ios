import PackageDescription

// Swift Package Manager manifest for the Scate iOS SDK.
//
// The SDK binary is the same ScateSDK.xcframework zip attached to each
// GitHub release (the artifact the podspec points at). The `ScateSDKAdjust`
// wrapper target exists because a binaryTarget cannot declare dependencies:
// it carries the Adjust SDK (with the Google ODM plugin, mirroring the
// podspec's `Adjust/AdjustGoogleOdm` dependency) so every SPM consumer gets
// Adjust linked automatically — ScateSDK reaches it at runtime.
//
// Points at the newest published release artifact. When the release
// automation uploads a new zip, it should also stamp `url` and `checksum`
// below (`swift package compute-checksum <zip>`) before tagging — SPM
// version tags only work when the tagged tree contains this file with the
// matching artifact. Until then, consume via branch "main".
